# The frick's this?
A control cardl for my "smart" home. (Bascically a glorified light switch...)
It controls IKEA Tr√•dfri lights and shows the current weather using wttr.in, just in case there's no window around.

The API is based on express.js, the frontend is vue.js


# Build and Run
* `npm run install_all` runs `npm install` for both the frontend and the server
* `npm run build_frontend` transpiles the vue frontend and copies the output to the server's static file location
* `npm run start_server` starts the express server that handles api requests and serves the frontend
* Application starts on the port defined in `/server/src/config.js`
